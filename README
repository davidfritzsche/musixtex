This is MusiXTeX, version 1.30 (2020-03-20).
MusiXTeX is a TeX-based system for typesetting music.

The main author was Daniel Taupin, who died in a climbing
accident in 2003; other authors credited in the MusiXTeX
manual are Andreas Egler and Ross Mitchell. MusiXTeX is now
being maintained by

The package includes

   + Postscript slur support, due to Stanislav Kneifl

   + musixlyr support for lyrics, due to Rainer Dunker

   + musixcrd support for chord symbols, due to Robert Hennig

   + support for music text in Palatino, Helvetica, Times 
     and EC fonts

   + several other extension packages 

   + a script musixflx.lua for the 2nd-pass processing

   + a script musixtex.lua that uses pre-processors prepmx,
     pmxab or autosp, as necessary, and automates the 3-pass
     etex -> musixflx -> [pdf]etex process, possibly
     followed by calls to dvips and ps2pdf (or dvipdfm) to
     convert the output to Portable Document Format (PDF)

   + wrapper scripts musixflx.bat and musixtex.bat for use on Windows

MusiXTeX fonts, including both the original metafont sources
and Type 1 versions by Takanori Uchiyama are in a separate
musixtex-fonts package, which must be installed before using
the MusiXTeX macros.

musixtex-install.{pdf,tex} is a more-detailed version of the
following instructions:

To install (on TDS-compliant TeX systems):

 +  unzip mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/musixtex.tds.zip at the root of a
    texmf tree and, if necessary, update the filename database; 
    e.g., texhash texmf.

 +  on Windows: move the scripts in Windows to a folder
    on the executable PATH (or add that folder to the PATH)

 +  on any Unix-like system: install symbolic links musixflx
    and musixtex in a directory on the executable PATH to
    scripts/musixtex/musixflx.lua and scripts/musixtex/musixtex.lua,
    respectively.

Documentation for MusiXTeX and friends is installed under 

doc/generic/musixtex

Documentation for the musixflx and musixtex scripts are in 

doc/generic/musixtex/scripts 

Many users, especially beginners, will find it easier to
use the PMX and M-Tx pre-processors, which accept a simpler
input language than MusiXTeX itself. Another pre-processor,
autosp, simplifies input to MusiXTeX by automatically
generating note-spacing commands. These pre-processor
packages may be found at CTAN under support. Additional
documentation, additional add-on packages, and many examples
of MusiXTeX typesetting may be found at the Werner Icking
