 \chapter{Postscript Slurs, Ties and Hairpins}\label{PostscriptSlurs}

\input musixps


All of the aforementioned limitations of font-based slurs can be circumvented
by using type~K Postscript slurs\footnote{``K'' stands for Stanislav Kneifl,
the developer of the type~K Postscript slur package.}. As well as slurs, the package includes
ties and crescendos.
Its use is very similar to font-based slurs, and in fact identical if only
the elementary slur and tie initiation and termination macros are used.

In order to use type~K Postscript slurs, ties and hairpins, you must first place \texttt{musixps.tex}
anywhere \TeX\ can find it. You must also place \texttt{psslurs.pro}
somewhere that \texttt{dvips} can find it.

The \index{mxsk font}\texttt{mxsk} font is required for ``half ties,'' which
are special symbols that are used by default for the second portion of a tie
that crosses a line break. If you like
this treatment you must install the font in your \TeX\ system. However, perfectly
acceptable line-breaking ties will appear if you invoke \keyindex{nohalfties},
and then you will not have to install this font.

Once the software mentioned in the prior two paragraphs is installed and the
\TeX\ filename database is refreshed, the type~K package can be
invoked by including the command \verb|\input musixps|
near the beginning of your source file (but after loading \verb\musixtex.tex\).
The resulting dvi file should then be converted into Postscript using \textbf{dvips}.
If desired, a PDF file can then be generated with \textbf{ps2pdf}, \textbf{ghostscript},
or \textbf{Adobe Acrobat} (see Section~\ref{using} for more information on this).

Two minor inconveniences with type~K Postscript slurs are that (1) they won't appear
in many dvi previewers, and (2) they won't appear in PDF files generated with
\textbf{pdftex} or \textbf{dvipdfm}. The former limitation can be circumvented by using a Postscript
viewer such as \textbf{GSview}. The latter simply requires that you create an intermediate
Postscript file with \textbf{dvips}, then make the PDF with any of the software
mentioned above.


\section{Initiating and terminating type K Postscript slurs}

Basic usage of type K slurs is the same as for font-based slurs. To initiate one,
use for example \verb|\isluru0g| to start an upper slur with ID 0 above a virtual note
at pitch level {\tt g}. To terminate one, use a command like
\verb|\tslur0i| which terminates the slur with ID 0 on a
virtual note at pitch level {\tt i}.
Both types of commands are non-spacing and must precede the first or last
note under the slur.

Termination macros are not restricted to being used
with their initiation counterpart. For example, a slur
beginning as a ``beam'' slur may be terminated as a
normal slur, or \emph{vice versa}. These would be achieved by using macro pairs
\verb|\ibslur...\tslur...| or \verb|\islur...\tbslur...|, respectively.
Unlike font-based slurs, adjusting the vertical positioning of the slur termination should not be necessary.

You can shift the starting or ending point slightly to the left
or right by substituting one of the commands \keyindex{ilsluru},
\keyindex{ilslurd}, \keyindex{irsluru},
\keyindex{irslurd}, \keyindex{trslur} or \keyindex{tlslur}.
For shifts farther to the left, use
\keyindex{iLsluru},
\keyindex{iLslurd} 
or \keyindex{tLslur}; 
for shifts farther to the right, use
\keyindex{iRsluru},
\keyindex{iRslurd} 
or \keyindex{tRslur}.


You can control the shape of type~K slurs with variants of
the termination command. To make the slur a bit flatter than default use
\keyindex{tfslur}0f; a bit higher, \keyindex{thslur}0f; higher still,
\keyindex{tHslur}0f;  or
even higher, \keyindex{tHHslur}0f.  These commands have an effect like
\keyindex{midslur} does for font-based slurs.

All combinations of the shifting and curvature variants are allowed,
e.g.\ \verb|\trHHslur|.


The following examples demonstrate how much better the type K slurs perform
in the extreme situations of the prior two typeset examples. The coding is
exactly the same as above except that \verb|\input musixps| has been added:
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
\begin{music}\nostartrule
\input musixps
\startextract\NOTes\multnoteskip3\isluru0c\ql c\tslur0s\ql s\en

\NOTes\isluru0c\ql c\en\notes\tslur0z\ql z\en
\zendextract
\end{music}

 


For maximal control over type K slurs, you can use one of the commands
\keyindex{iSlur}~$npvh$ and
\keyindex{tSlur}~$npvhca$, where the characters in
$npvhca$ respectively stand for ID number, height, vertical offset, horizontal offset,
curvature, and angularity.
All offsets are in \verb|internote|, and the slur direction is determined
by the sign of the vertical offset. See the comments in \verb|musixps.tex|
for precise definitions of the other parameters. Examples of permissible forms for
these commands are
\verb|iSlur0c11| and \verb|tSlur0{!d}11{.2}0|.

The next example shows how you can use \verb|iSlur| in difficult
circumstances:


\begin{music}\nostartrule
\nobarnumbers
\generalsignature1%
\generalmeter{\meterfrac{2}{4}}%
\nostartrule
\startextract

\NOtes\zh{'d}\zhu{`f}\off{7.2pt}\tSlur0{'b}{.5}{-1}{.3}0\ql b\ql b\en
\zendextract
\end{music}
\noindent with this coding:

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
\NOtes\irslurd0{'b}\zhl b\sk\zq{!e}\qu{'c}\en\bar
\NOtes\zh{'d}\zhu{`f}\off{7.2pt}\tlslur0{'b}\ql b\ql b\en\bar
%

\NOtes\zh{'d}\zhu{`f}\off{7.2pt}\tlfslur0{'b}\ql b\ql b\en\bar
%
\NOtes\iSlur0{'b}{-.5}3\zhl b\sk\zq{!e}\qu{'c}\en\bar
\NOtes\zh{'d}\zhu{`f}\off{7.2pt}\tSlur0{'b}{.5}{-1}{.3}0\ql b\ql b\en
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


The ID number for a slur, tie or crescendo should
normally range from $0$ to $9$. If it is bigger
than nine but less than $15$,
the object can cross a line break but not a page break. If bigger than
14 but less than $2^{31}$, it can't be broken at all,
        nor can a slur termination be positioned at a beam with
        e.g., \verb|\tbsluru{17684}{16}|; however \verb|\ibsluru{152867}{16}| is okay.

It's also okay to have opened simultaneously a slur, tie and crescendo all
with the same ID, or a slur, tie and decrescendo, but not a crescendo and
decrescendo.

\section{Type~K Postscript beam slurs}
Type~K beam slurs are defined differently than the font-based ones:
They require as parameters both a slur ID number $n$ and a beam ID number $m$,
but that's all. The commands are
\keyindex{iBsluru}\emen, \keyindex{iBslurd}\emen, and
\keyindex{tBslur}\emen.
They must be placed \ital{after} the beam initiation or termination command.
Type~K slurs may start on one beam and end on another.
For example,

\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
\Notes\ibu0i0\iBsluru00\qb0{eh}\tbu0\qb0i\ibu0j0\qb0{jl}\tbu0%
 \slurtext{6}\tBslur00\qb0e\en
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}

\noindent produces
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[scale=1]{./mxdexamples/psbeamslur.eps}
%\end{center}

\begin{music}\nostartrule\startextract
\Notes\ibu0g2\iBsluru00\qb0{eh}\tbu0\qb0i\ibu0j0\qb0{jl}\tbu0%
 \slurtext{6}\tBslur00\qb0e\en
\zendextract
\end{music}

This example also illustrates the use of the macro
\keyindex{slurtext}. It has just one parameter---some text to be
printed---and it centers it just above or below the midpoint of
the next slur that is closed.
This works only for non-breaking slurs; if the slur is broken,
the text
disappears\footnote{If you insist on viewing files with a dvi viewer that
doesn't display 
type~K slurs, you may also find that
figures placed with \keyindex{slurtext} will appear at the end of the
slur rather than the middle.}.
%The placing of the slur text is done with a very dirty Postscript
%hack, so I am not really sure that everything you want to typeset
%will be placed at the correct position (if you are interested, see
%the end of psslurs.pro for details). If you find something that won't
%work, let me know.

% DAS: why do we need this ???
%\paragraph{General coding for Postscript slurs and ties of type K.}
%This can be done by:
%\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
%\i[h.shift]slur[u|d]{slur ID}{note height}
%\t[h.shift][slur height]slur{slur ID}{note height}
%\iBslur[u|d]{slur ID}{beam ID}
%\tB[slur.height]slur{slur ID}{beam ID}
%\end{verbatim}\end{quote}
%\noindent where h.shift can be 'l', 'r' or nothing
%and slur.height can be 'f', nothing, 'h', 'H' or 'HH'
%
%Example: \keyindex{tlfslur} means 'terminate left flat slur'.
%
%
%There are also simple slurs with same invocation and parameters as the
%original ones.

\section{Type~K Postscript ties}
All of the foregoing Type~K slur commands 
except the shape-changing ones
have counterparts for ties. Simply
replace ``\verb|slur|'' with ``\verb|tie|'', and for terminations omit
the pitch parameter. Type~K ties not only are positioned differently by
default, but they also have different shapes than slurs. If you want to change
the shape of a tie, redefine \verb|\pstiehgt| from its default of $0.7$. 

\section{Dotted type K slurs and ties.}%please check the capital D(otted)
A slur or tie can be made dotted simply by entering \keyindex{dotted} anywhere before
the beginning of the slur or tie. Only the first slur or tie following this
command will be affected. On the other hand, if you enter \keyindex{Dotted}, then \emph{all}
slurs and ties from this point forward will be dotted until you say
\keyindex{Solid}. Furthermore, inside \verb|\Dotted...\Solid| you can make any individual
slur or tie solid saying \verb|\solid| before its beginning.

\section{Avoiding collisions with staff lines.}
In Postscript it is possible to do computations that would be very hard
to implement directly in TeX. Type~K slurs can use this facility to check whether
the curve of a slur or tie is anywhere nearly tangent to any staff line, and if
so, to adjust
the altitude of the curve to avoid the collision. By default this feature is turned
on.
You can disable it either
globally (\keyindex{Nosluradjust}, \keyindex{Notieadjust}) or locally
(\keyindex{nosluradjust}, \keyindex{notieadjust}), and you can also turn it
back on globally (\keyindex{Sluradjust},
\keyindex{Tieadjust}) or locally (\keyindex{sluradjust}, \keyindex{tieadjust}).
Here ``locally''
means that the command will only affect the next slur or tie to be opened.

\section{Type K Postscript hairpins}\label{kcresc}

There are two different types. The first type is normally initiated with either
\keyindex{icresc}\onen~or \keyindex{idecresc}\onen, and terminated with
\keyindex{tcresc}\onen, where $n$ is a hairpin index,
which is virtually unlimited but certain restrictions apply if it exceeds $14$.
The altitude is set by the value of \keyindex{setcrescheight}, which by default
is $-5$ and which must be expressed numerically. Note that
\keyindex{tcresc}~is the same as \keyindex{tdecresc}.

You can shift the starting or ending point horizontally by replacing the
foregoing macros with
\keyindex{ilcresc},    \keyindex{ildecresc},
\keyindex{ircresc},    \keyindex{irdecresc},
\keyindex{tlcresc},    \keyindex{tldecresc},
\keyindex{trcresc},    \keyindex{trdecresc},
for example to make space for an alphabetic dynamic mark.

The second form of Postscript hairpin macros allows individual and arbitrary
specification of the altitude and horizontal offset. The syntax is
\keyindex{Icresc}\itbrace{n}\itbrace{h}\itbrace{s}, where $h$ is the
altitude---which must be numerical---and $s$ is the horizontal offset
in \verb|\internote|. Similar syntax obtains for \keyindex{Idecresc}\
and \keyindex{Tcresc}.

These hairpins may span several lines. If one of them spans three systems
then the height of the middle section can be adjusted with
\keyindex{liftcresc}\itbrace{n}\itbrace{h}. The height of the first and last
parts of a broken crescendo will be defined by the height parameter in
\keyindex{Icresc}~or \keyindex{Tcresc}.

There are numerous other nuances and shorthand macros that are described
in the comments in \verb|musixps.tex|.

As an example of a Postscript hairpin,

\generalmeter{\meterfrac{12}8}

\Notes\ccharnote{-8}{\ppp}\Icresc0{-7}6\ca{bdegh'bde}\en
\Notes\Tcresc0{-4}{-2}\zcharnote{-5}{\fff}\ca{'f}\en
\zendextract
\end{music}

\noindent  was coded as
\begin{quote}\begin{verbatim}
\input musixps
\generalmeter{\meterfrac{12}8}
\startextract
\Notes\ccharnote{-8}{\ppp}\Icresc0{-7}6\ca{bdegh'bde}\en
\Notes\Tcresc0{-4}{-2}\zcharnote{-5}{\fff}\ca{'f}\en
\zendextract
\end{verbatim}\end{quote}


\section{Line-breaking slurs, ties and hairpins}
Tyle K slurs, ties and crescendos going across line breaks are handled
automatically. In fact they can go over more lines than two (this is
true also for ties, though it would be somewhat strange).

There is a switch \verb|\ifslopebrkslurs| that controls the default
height of the end point
of the first segment of all broken slurs. By default the height will be
the same as the beginning. To have it raised by \verb|3\internote|, simply
issue the command \keyindex{slopebrkslurstrue}. To revert to the default,
use \keyindex{slopebrkslursfalse}.

To locally override the default height of the end of the first segment,
use the command \keyindex{breakslur}\enpee,
which sets the height for slur number $n$ to pitch $p$, just like with
font-based slurs.

You can raise or lower the starting point of the second segment of a broken slur
with the command \keyindex{liftslur}\verb|{|$n$\verb|}{|$h$\verb|}|, with
parameters slur ID and relative offset in
\verb|\internote|s measured from the slur beginning. Its effect is
the same as \keyindex{Liftslur} for font-based slurs, except it is not
necessary to code
it within \verb|\atnextstaff{}|, just anywhere inside the slur.

As already mentioned, anything with $\mathrm{ID}<10$ is broken fully automatically, but
you should be careful about slurs, ties and crescendos with $10\le\mathrm{ID}<15$.
These cannot cross page breaks, although they can cross line breaks.

If the second segment of a broken tie is less than 15pt long, then by
default it will have a special shape which begins horizontally. These shapes are
called \ital{half ties} and are contained in the font \index{mxsk font}\verb|mxsk|.
Of course if they are to be used, the font files must be integrated into the
\TeX\ installation. Their use can be turned off with \keyindex{nohalfties}
and back on with \keyindex{halfties}.

%\paragraph{Backwards compatibility.}
%There are several ``aliases'' which allow to use the old, bitmapped slur
%commands for PS slurs without any change. There are however a few differences:
%the \keyindex{invertslur} is not implemented yet and
%the \keyindex{curve} and \keyindex{midslur} macros have no effect.

%\paragraph{Memory requirements.}
\enlargethispage*{4ex}
\section{A few final technical details}
Each \verb|\i...| and \verb|\t...|
produces a \verb|\special| command, which must be stored in TeX's main memory.
Therefore, if too many slurs occur in one page, some memory problems could
occur. The only solution is to use font-based slurs.
%The only solutions are to use Big\TeX\ 
%BigTex? it is apparently the mascot for the Texas State Fair

Type~K slurs need the Postscript header file
\index{psslurs.pro}\texttt{psslurs.pro} to be included in the
output Postscript file. This is made to happen by the \TeX\ command
\verb|\special{header=psslurs.pro}|, which is automatically
included when you \verb|\input musixps|. So normally this is not
of concern. However if you wish to extract a subset of pages from
the master \verb|dvi| file using \index{dvidvi}\texttt{dvidvi}, then
you have three options: (1)~include the first page in the subset,
(2)~manually issue the
\verb|\special| command in the \TeX\ source for the first page of the subset, or
(3)~use the option \texttt{-h psslurs.pro} when you run \texttt{dvips}.
