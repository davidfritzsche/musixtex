1. DESCRIPTION

This package provides PostScript (type 1) fonts (PFB format), and dvips and
dvipdfm map files for MusiXTeX. The fonts are based on the original METAFONT
sources, such as musix20.mf, which are distributed with MusiXTeX. The fonts
provided here may be used to produce printer-independent Postscript files. PDF
files generated using type 1 fonts are well displayed by the Acrobat Reader and
xpdf.

The fonts were generated from the METAFONT sources in the TeX Live CD 2000 July
using TeXtrace 0.45 or mftrace 1.0.12 but musix11-20, xslhz20 and xslhz20d 
were upgraded to those in musixtex-T102.tar.gz.

Here is a list of the 71 generated fonts.

xgreg20.pfb  xsld24d.pfb  xslhd20d.pfb xslhu20d.pfb xslu16d.pfb

Note: musix25 and xgreg25 were not generated because they are not used in 
      musixgre.tex or musixtex.tex.


The control points were reduced with Fontographer.
The fonts were hinted automatically with Fontographer.  musix11 - 29 were
hand tuned by Takanori Uchiyama.

2. METHOD

Most of fonts were generated using TeXtrace 0.45 running on Mac OS X 10.0.4.
xslz20 was generated using mftrace 1.0.12 running on Mac OS X 10.2.3.
Thirty-two fonts were generated with the original traceall.sh script. Others
were generated with traceall.sh modified by Takanori Uchiyama. The modification
involved reducing resolution, corresponding to enlargement of "1 thou" in
traceall.sh. The following are lists of fonts that were generated with N-fold
thou scripts.

twofold
  musix11, musix13, xsld11, xsld11d, xsld13, xsld13d, xsld16, xsld16d,
  xslhd13, xslhd13d, xslhd16, xslhd16d, xslhd20, xslhd20d, xslhd24d,
  xslhu13, xslhu13d, xslhu16, xslhu16d, xslhu20, xslhu20d, xslhu24d,
  xslu13, xslu13d, xslu16, xslu16d, xslud20

threefold
  musixsps, musixspx, xslhd11, xslhd11d, xslhu11, xslhu11d, xslz20, xslz20d

fivefold
  xslhz20, xslhz20d, xtie20

The reason for reducing resolution is that METAFONT supports only limited
values of real numbers and so cannot generate very high resolution MusiXTeX
fonts.

3. INSTALLATION

  1) Make a directory such as $TEXMF/fonts/type1/musixtex, for PFBs.  
  2) Copy all PFBs to the above directory; they should be readable by all users.
  3) Copy the map file ./dvips/musix.map to the appropriate directory, such as
     $TEXMF/dvips/config
  4) Add a line 

      p +musix.map

     to a suitable config.xxx file or, in a tetex-based distribution, add 
     musix.map to the list of map files for Type1 fonts with Metafont 
     equivalents in the updmap script, which should then be executed 
     by doing "./updmap".
  5) Copy the map file ./dvipdfm/musix.map to the appropriate directory, such as
     $TEXMF/dvipdfm/config
  6) Add a line

      f musix.map

     to the config file.
  7) Do mktexlsr or texhash or whatever is necessary on your system to
     re-generate the TeX database.

When these fonts are used, type 1 fonts should also be used for non-music text;
for example, type 1 versions of the Computer Modern fonts are available.

4. TODO

  + Hinting 
  + Modifying METAFONT sources to get high resolution outputs
