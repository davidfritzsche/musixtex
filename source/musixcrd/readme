Chord setting for musixtex or pmx.

There exist two distributions, the sources and the compiled on.
The sources are only necessary for development. Normal usage
requires only the compiled version.


compiled distribution
---------------------
  The archive musixcrd.tgz contains the following files:

  o readme           this file
  o musixcrd.tex     tex macros
  o doc.pdf          documentation 

  Put the musixcrd.tex file or an link to it into your 
  musixtex/pmx working directory. For pmx use the lines

  ---
  \input musixtex                   % These commands are necessary
  \input pmx                        % because pmx.tex MUST be \input
  \input musixcrd
  ---

  as preamble in your pmx source file to include musixcrd.tex.
  Look at doc.ps for further instructions of how to use musixcrd.
